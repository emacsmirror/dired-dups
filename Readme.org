How to create documentation and distribute package:

 -     1) Generate a bitcoin address for donations with shell command :: bitcoin getaccountaddress dired-dups
 -        and place address after "Commentary ::" above.
    2) Use org-readme-top-header-to-readme to create initial Readme.org file.
    3) Use M-x auto-document to insert descriptions of commands and documents
    4) Create documentation in the Readme.org file:
       - Use org-mode features for structuring the data.
       - Divide the commands into different categories and create headings
         containing org lists of the commands in each category.
       - Create headings with any other extra information if needed (e.g. customization).
    5) In this buffer use org-readme-to-commentary to fill Commentary section with
       documentation from Readme.org file.
    6) Make any necessary adjustments to the documentation in this file (e.g. remove the installation
       and customization sections added in previous step since these should already be present).
    7) Use org-readme-marmalade-post and org-readme-convert-to-emacswiki to post
       the library on Marmalade and EmacsWiki respectively.
